# CS50-NodeArray---AVL-Tree
I am retrieving a 143 thousand word dictionary and loading it into a an treenode pointer array of size 702. That is a an array with the first 26 pointers pointing to just individual letters. Then the other 676 span from aa to zz. With most of those being filled with AVL Trees
